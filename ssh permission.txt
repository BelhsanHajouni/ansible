/etc/ssh/sshd.config ==> PermitRootLogin yes : it allows me to makes the VMs be able to ssh on each other manually
************
to allow the VMs ssh on each other using ansible in addition to password we need the private key so :
 	- ssh-keygen
	- the key is store in /root/.ssh/id_rsa
	- copy the key to the slave VMs : ssh-copy-id root@hostname or ip@
